How to make your own version:

Take a regular version of Diversi-DOS, and save the $BF00-BFFF and $D700-FFFF regions to disk.
Make whatever changes you will to that image.
Fill the following regions with zeroes in the $D700 region:
 - the read buffer at $1DBC-1FFF;
 - the translate tables at offsets $2329-2368 and $2396-23FF (the unpacker will regenerate them);
 - the write buffer at $2500-2655
Concatenate the two images, with the $BF00 region first (to create a file named "d600-ffff").
Reverse the order of the bytes in the image (to create a file named "d600-ffff.rev").
Compress the result with aPLib ("appack c d600-ffff.rev d600-ffff.rev.pak").
Remove the $18 bytes header from the resulting file.  The file size must not exceed $1F00 bytes!
Reverse the order of the bytes in the image (to create a file named "d600-ffff.rev.pak.rev").
Build the unpacker code with ACME.  The compressed image will be linked automatically to the output file.
Write the output file to disk, beginning with T00 S01.
